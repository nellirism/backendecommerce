## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Associations

*Execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:*

- Product belongs to Category, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

- Category has many Product models.

- Product belongs to many Tag models. Using the ProductTag through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products.

- Tag belongs to many Product models.
